Differential Expression and Pathway Enrichment Analysis of  differentially expressed miRNAs

This analysis was performed as part of my Master's project in Molecular Medicine. 
The focus of the study was to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and perform pathway enrichment analysis.

This was my first time working with R and programming in general.
As such, the script may show mistakes and/or suboptimal coding. Any feedback is welcome.
